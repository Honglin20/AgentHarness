/**
 * useAgentOutline — React binding for the outline list.
 *
 * Two data sources, picked at runtime:
 *
 *  1. Sidecar store (replay mode): when the backend persists a pre-computed
 *     outline summary (`{run_id}+outline.json`), `applyHydration` populates
 *     the scoped outline store and we render directly from it — O(items),
 *     no scan over the conversation. This is the fast path for switching to
 *     historical runs.
 *
 *  2. Derivation (live mode + fallback): when the sidecar is absent (live
 *     run, legacy run, fetch failure, or computation failure at save time),
 *     the store's `items` stays `null` and we derive from the full
 *     conversation via `deriveOutlineItems`. Live runs always take this path
 *     because the sidecar is only written at workflow-completion.
 *
 * The fallback path is what keeps the outline correct during the live →
 * replay transition window: hydration may not have completed when the
 * component first renders, so we derive from the (possibly still-empty)
 * messages until the sidecar arrives.
 *
 * Folding: after deriving/loading per-iter items, we fold by nodeId at the
 * view layer (`groupOutlineByNode`). Sidebar renders one row per agent;
 * iter is chosen inside the detail panel's dropdown. See plan
 * `2026-06-17-outline-iter-collapse.md` Decision 1.
 *
 * Note: useWorkflowStore returns StoreApi | null (no active workflow on the
 * start page). The non-null assertion on the useStore calls matches the
 * convention at ScopedConversationTab.tsx:476 — the surrounding
 * WorkflowScope guarantees the store is non-null by the time components
 * consuming outline data render.
